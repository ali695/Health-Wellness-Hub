Replace ALL generic SVG illustrations on every calculator page 
with beautiful, detailed, professional SVG illustrations. 
The current SVGs look too simple and generic. 

Make every SVG unique, colorful, visually rich, and 
professionally designed like premium health app illustrations.

               (think: Headspace, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health)
ViewBox: "0 0 600 340"
Style: Modern flat illustration with depth
       Subtle gradients, rounded shapes, layered elements
       Multiple colors — NOT just 2-3 flat shapes

Each SVG must have:
  - Minimum 15-20 distinct SVG elements
  - Gradient definitions in <defs>
  - At least 2 linear or radial gradients used
  - Decorative background shape (circle, blob, or rectangle)
  - Main illustration object (detailed, recognizable)

    (chart, meter, gauge, progress bar, number badge)
  - Subtle shadow effects using filter or darker shapes
  - <title> tag for accessibility
  - role="img" aria-labelledby on <svg> tag
  - NO placeholder circles pretending to be food/objects
  - Must be INSTANTLY recognizable as the calculator topic
